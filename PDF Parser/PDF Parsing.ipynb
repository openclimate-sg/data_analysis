    "The above code for information was an oversimplified attempt of the research paper titled [Prescription Extraction Using CRFs and Word Embeddings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5551970/). By training context specific datasets and entity relationships much better results could be obtained for the above approach.\n",

    "In the course of working on this project, it was found that there is still a lack of standardization around the documents used for climate action proposals. A standard structure would go a long way in aiding such information extraction from PDFs, especially due to the lack of availability of proper libraries for working with PDFs."
